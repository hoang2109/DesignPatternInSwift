# Design Pattern in Swift
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in object-oriented design. They are like pre-made blueprints that can use to solve a recurring design problem in the code.
There are 23 patterns according to "the GoF book". They can be categorized into three categories.
-   **Creational patterns**  provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
-   **Structural patterns**  explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
-   **Behavioral patterns**  take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
